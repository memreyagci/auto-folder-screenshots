## Auto-Folder Screenshots

Just a small Python script to automatically save screenshots into a given folder if the active window's title matches the specified string.

I've been studying for the *AWS CCP Foundational* exam and watching [this 14-hour video from Free Code Camp](https://youtu.be/NhDYbskXRgc), from which I take a lot of screenshots.

I was frustrated with how long it took to save them to my AWS study materials folder.

I needed to:
- Press *Prt Sc*
- Select the area
- Click the screenshot notification
- Right-click image
- Click *Save As*
- Choose the desired folder
- Click *Save*

Too many steps for a task I do regularly.

Now all I have to do is:
- Press a screenshot shortcut

It checks the title of the active window and if it matches, saves it to the desired folder. If not, runs Snipping Tool as usual.
 
**It only works on Windows**, as it uses platform-specific packages such as [win32gui](https://pypi.org/project/win32gui/) to get active window title, and [win11toast](https://pypi.org/project/win11toast/) to send a notification.

### How to run:

Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/memreyagci/auto-folder-screenshots
```

Install dependencies:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Update the following variables in **[run.py](./run.py)**:
```python
# Window title to match
desired_window = "AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certification Course (CLF-C02) - Pass the Exam! - YouTube - Brave"

# Folder to save screenshots
save_dir = os.environ['USERPROFILE'] + '\\Desktop\\AWS Practice\\'
```

Finally, you can either run it manually to test:
```sh
python run.py
```

Or assign a keyboard shortcut to it (the intended way to use it). [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) app is what I use to do this.
